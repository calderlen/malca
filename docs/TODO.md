- obtain "recently calibrated" light curves for 15-15.5, 15.5-16 mag. dom's newly calibrated light curves only go down to 15 mag 
- need to collect camera# for each peak detected
- crossmatch w/ VSX earlier inthe pipeline so you can filter out known types earlier -- can also grab data such as period (when available) to reduce LSP calls; make sure code is aware when period is detected and when it isn't
- adapt camfilter and camfilter2 from more_utils?
